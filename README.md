- 👋 Hi, I’m @elbangue
- 👀 I’m interested in bioinformatics applied to protein evolution
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more python...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on protein coevolution as a way to predict protein-protein interactions. 
- 📫 How to reach me, write to elbange@gmail.com
I am a biologist with coding skills...no more than that, ok.
